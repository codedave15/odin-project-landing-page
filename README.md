The Odin Project: Landing Page

📄 Overview

This is a Landing Page Project created as part of my learning journey in web development. The project focuses on building a simple static website while practicing and applying the foundations of CSS.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to understand the structure and styling of a modern landing page using only HTML and CSS. It covers layout design, responsive elements, typography, and basic visual hierarchy.

🌐 About the Landing Page

The landing page showcases a fictional digital product designed to help users create effective web pages. It includes a hero section, features breakdown, a testimonial, and a call-to-action – all styled using custom CSS.
